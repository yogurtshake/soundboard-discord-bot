-create bot clone specifically for testing? (would just need it locally)

-add bot message prefix to all messages? (something like "->")? would help distinguish between separate messages.

-fix issue of crash when bot is force moved between VCs by server admin?

-add discord developer instructions to readme?

-add !deletesound command for admins

-change !upload to allow for sound name input from user?

-maybe aggregate !addtrigger, !removetrigger, !triggerlist into one !triggers command? (same with !sequences, !loops)

-maybe use discord.Embed() for cleaner interface for !help, !config, and !roles ???
