-prettier formatting?

-create custom help command (different for not home server)

-add config folder and !config command that allows user to edit default bot command message responses (stored in different text files?)
	-allow user to set default bot channel
	-have bot send any non-context based messages to default channel (restart message)

-perhaps add command that allows for sound files to be sent to the bot through discord (and added to server's sound folder)? security risk? definitely admin only

-TO TEST: add bot to new server

-loop command broke the bot???
