feel free to implement any or all of these changes for your own version. this is just stuff I haven't gotten around to yet.


-fix issue of crash when bot is force moved between VCs by server admin

-add !deletesound command for admins

-change !upload to allow for sound name input from user

-to mirror !roles and !config, maybe aggregate !addtrigger, !removetrigger, !triggerlist into one !triggers command? (same with !sequences, !loops)

-maybe use discord.Embed() for cleaner interface for !help, !config, and !roles ?
