-perhaps add command that allows for sound files to be sent to the bot through discord (and added to server's sound folder)? security risk? definitely admin only

-create bot clone specifically for testing? (would just need it locally)

-add bot message prefix to all messages? (something like "->")? would help distinguish between separate messages.

-fix issue of crash when bot is force moved between VCs by server admin?

-add discord developer instructions to readme?

-fix lower casing of sound file name of bot's file attachment when !download is called
