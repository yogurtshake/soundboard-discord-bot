-prettier formatting?

-FIX PROBLEM OF DOUBLE SCRIPT INSTANCE
-add routine check for any unexpected second processes?
-add bot command that kills all but one?

-create custom help command (different for not home server)

-add config folder and !config command that allows user to edit default bot command message responses (stored in different text files?)

-commands to add multi-server functionality to:

	-addtrigger, removetrigger, triggerlist.

-add !loop command to loop specific sound. (copy paste logic from !s, add loop.)

-fix on_message triggers

-perhaps add command that allows for sound files to be sent to the bot through discord (and added to server's sound folder)? security risk? definitely admin only
